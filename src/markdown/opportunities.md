You see specific strategies here, but there are many other great ways to spread gifts.

In all of these cases, recording appreciation for others via [Time
Safari](https://timesafari.app) is a great way to spread the love. :-)

## Have time?

- Consider who could use a text or a phone call right now.

- Look for events that you enjoy and go ask how you can help.

- [Search on Time Safari](https://timesafari.app/discover) for projects close to your neighborhood or close to your interests. Contact us to join the network.

## Have expertise?

- Do an online search for that hobby, even in your area... you may be surprised.
  If not, consider creating some posts or videos about it on your favorite
  platform, and you'll attract others.

- If you've got friends, ask them what kind of sharing would be fun.

- [Time Safari](https://timesafari.app/discover) can help connect you to a group that could use your expertise. Contact us to join and connect.

## Have money?

- Money is easy to give: be sure to consider both short- and long-term
  consequences, and both local and global contexts. That way you gain a balance
  of deep & close relationships alongside the benefits of wider but more shallow
  impact.
